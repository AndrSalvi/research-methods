## Tutorials: Research Methods in Political Science (PO3600)

Welcome! This site contains useful material for the tutorials of the module [Reserach Methods for Political Science](https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/undergraduate/module-outlines/js/research-methods/). In particular, I will use this site to publish links to useful papers, tutorials, or general advice. If you have any questions feel free to get in [contact](http://muellerstefan.net/#contact) with me. You find the slides of the lectures, homeworks and dataset on [Blackboard](http://tcd.ie/blackboard).

### Get and install SPSS

This course is based on SPSS. You are free to use alternative (and free) statistical software such as [R](https://www.r-project.org) or [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org). As a TCD student, you get a free SPSS license from the [IT Service](https://www.tcd.ie/itservices/help/it-service-desk-contact.php). What you need to do: Either you go to the IT Service Desk, get an installation DVD and fill out a form, or you print the [form](https://www.tcd.ie/itservices/assets/doc/purchase_local/SPSS-Form.pdf), bring it to the IT Service Desk and download SPSS directly from the [TCD download website](https://software.tcd.ie). Note that you will need to be logged in to the TCD wifi to download the software. Once you got the files, follow the instructions provided in the PDF file.
